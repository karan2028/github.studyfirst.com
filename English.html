<font size="7">Long Essay on Environment Pollution </font><br>

<h1>Introduction</h1><br>

<p><font size="5">The environment is the surrounding of an organism. The environment in which an organism lives is made up of various components like air, water, land, etc. These components are found in fixed proportions to create a harmonious balance in the environment for the organism to live in. Any kind of undesirable and unwanted change in the proportions of these components can be termed as pollution. This issue is increasing with every passing year. It is an issue that creates economic, physical, and social troubles. The environmental problem that is worsening with each day needs to be addressed so that its harmful effects on humans as well as the planet can be discarded.</font></p><br>
<font size="5"><h3>Causes of Environmental Pollution</h3> <br>
<p>With the rise of the industries and the migration of people from villages to cities in search of employment, there has been a regular increase in the problem of proper housing and unhygienic living conditions. These reasons have given rise to factors that cause pollution.</p> <br>

<p>Environmental pollution is of five basic types namely, Air, Water, Soil, and Noise pollution.</p>

<font size="5"><b>Air Pollution</font>:</b> Air pollution is a major issue in today’s world. The smoke pouring out of factory chimneys and automobiles pollute the air that we breathe in. Gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulphur dioxide are emitted with this smoke which mixes with air and causes great harm to the human body, flora, and fauna. The dry-farm waste, dry grass, leaves, and coal used as domestic fuels in our villages also produce harmful gases. Acid rain occurs due to an excess of sulphur dioxide in the air.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"> <b>The Main Sources of Air Pollution are as Follows: </font><br></b>

<font size="5"><li>Automobile pollution <br></li>

<li>Industrial air pollution <br></li>

<li>Burning garbage <br></li>

<li>Brick kilns <br></li>

<li>Indoor air pollution <br></li>

<li>Decomposed animals and plants <br></li>

<li>Radioactive elements<br></li></font>

 <br>

`<font size="5"><b>Water Pollution:</b>Water pollution is one of the most serious environmental issues. The waste products from the growing industries and sewage water are not treated properly before disposing of the wastewater into the rivers and other water bodies, thus leading to water pollution. Agricultural processes with excess fertilizers and pesticides also pollute the water bodies.<br> </font>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>The Main Sources of Water Pollution as Follows: <br></b>
<li>Marine commerce. <br></li>

<li>Industrial effluents joining seas and oceans. <br></li>

<li>Dumping of radioactive substances into seawater. <br></li>

<li>Sewage is disposed of into the sea by rivers. <br></li>

<li>Offshore oil rigs. <br></li>

<li>Recreational activities. <br></li>

<li>    Agricultural pollutants are disposed of into the water bodies.<br></li></font>

  <br>

<font size="5"><b>Soil or Land Pollution:</b> Soil pollution or land pollution results from the deposition of solid waste, accumulation of biodegradable material, deposition of chemicals with poisonous chemical compositions, etc on the open land. Waste materials such as plastics, polythene, and bottles, cause land pollution and render the soil infertile. Moreover, the dumping of dead bodies of animals adds to this issue. Soil pollution causes several diseases in man and animals like Cholera, Dysentery, Typhoid, etc.<br></font>
<br>
<font size="5">The Main Causes of Soil Pollution are as Follows:

<font size="5"><li>Industrial waste<br>

<li>Urban commercial and domestic waste <br>

<li>Chemical fertilizers <br>

<li>Biomedical waste <br>

<li>Pesticides<br></font>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Noise Pollution:</font></b> With an increasing population, urbanization, and industrialization, noise pollution is becoming a serious form of pollution affecting human life, health, and comfort in daily life. Horns of vehicles, loudspeakers, music systems, and industrial activities contribute to noise pollution. <br>
<br>
<font size="5">The Main Sources of Noise Pollution as Follows:</font><br>

<li>The machines in the factories and industries produce whistling sounds, crushing noise, and thundering sounds.<br> 

<li>Loudspeakers, horns of vehicles.<br> 

<li>Blasting of rocks and earth, drilling tube wells, ventilation fans, and heavy earth-moving machinery at construction sites<br>

<br>

<font size="5"><b>How Pollution Harms Health and Environment</font></b>
The lives of people and other creatures are affected by environmental pollution, both directly and indirectly. For centuries, these living organisms have coexisted with humans on the planet.<br> 
<br>
<font size="5"><b>1. Effect on the Environment</font></b><br>

Smog is formed when carbon and dust particles bind together in the air, causing respiratory problems, haze, and smoke. These are created by the combustion of fossil fuels in industrial and manufacturing facilities and vehicle combustion of carbon fumes.<br> 

Furthermore, these factors impact the immune systems of birds, making them carriers of viruses and diseases. It also has an impact on the body's system and organs.<br> 
<br>
<font size="5"><b>2.  Land, Soil, and Food Effects </font></b><br>

The degradation of human organic and chemical waste harms the land and soil. It also releases chemicals into the land and water. Pesticides, fertilisers, soil erosion, and crop residues are the main causes of land and soil pollution. <br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>3. Effects on water </font></b><br>

Water is easily contaminated by any pollutant, whether it be human waste or factory chemical discharge. We also use this water for crop irrigation and drinking. They, too, get polluted as a result of infection. Furthermore, an animal dies as a result of drinking the same tainted water.<br> 

Furthermore, approximately 80% of land-based pollutants such as chemical, industrial, and agricultural waste wind up in water bodies.<br> 

Furthermore, because these water basins eventually link to the sea, they contaminate the sea's biodiversity indirectly. <br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>4. Food Reaction</font></b><br>

Crops and agricultural produce become poisonous as a result of contaminated soil and water. These crops are laced with chemical components from the start of their lives until harvest when they reach a mass level. Due to this, tainted food has an impact on our health and organs. <br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>5. Climate Change Impact </font></b><br>

Climate change is also a source of pollution in the environment. It also has an impact on the ecosystem's physical and biological components.<br> 

Ozone depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming are all examples of environmental pollution. Because these water basins eventually link to the sea, they contaminate the sea's biodiversity indirectly. Furthermore, their consequences may be fatal for future generations. The unpredictably cold and hot climate impacts the earth’s natural system.<br> 

Furthermore, earthquakes, starvation, smog, carbon particles, shallow rain or snow, thunderstorms, volcanic eruptions, and avalanches are all caused by climate change, caused entirely by environmental pollution.<br>

 
<br>
<font size="5"><b>How to Minimise Environmental Pollution? </font></b><br>
<br>
To minimise this issue, some preventive measures need to be taken.<br> 

<font size="5"><b>Principle of 3R’s:</font></b> To save the environment, use the principle of 3 R’s; Reuse, Reduce and Recycle.<br> 

Reuse products again and again. Instead of throwing away things after one use, find a way to use them again.  Reduce the generation of waste products.<br>  
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Recycle:</font></b> Paper, plastics, glass, and electronic items can be processed into new products while using fewer natural resources and lesser energy. <br>

 
<br>
To prevent and control air pollution, better-designed equipment, and smokeless fuels should be used in homes and industries. More and more trees should be planted to balance the ecosystem and control greenhouse effects. <br>
<br>
Noise pollution can be minimised by better design and proper maintenance of vehicles. Industrial noise can be reduced by soundproofing equipment like generators, etc.<br>  
<br>
To control soil pollution, we must stop the usage of plastic. Sewage should be treated properly before using it as fertilizers and as landfills. Encourage organic farming as this process involves the use of biological materials and avoiding synthetic substances to maintain soil fertility and ecological balance.<br> 
<br>
Several measures can be adopted to control water pollution. Some of them are water consumption and usage that can be minimized by altering the techniques involved. Water should be reused with treatment.<br> 
<br>
The melting icebergs in Antarctica resulted in rising sea levels due to the world's environmental pollution, which had become a serious problem due to global warming, which had become a significant concern. Rising carbon pollution poses a risk for causing natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, and other natural disasters. <br>
<br>
The Hiroshima-Nagasaki and Chernobyl disasters in Russia have irreversibly harmed humanity. Different countries around the world are responding to these calamities in the most effective way possible.<br> 
<br>
Different countries around the world are responding to these calamities in the most effective way possible. More public awareness campaigns are being established to educate people about the hazards of pollution and the importance of protecting our environment. Greener lifestyles are becoming more popular; for example, energy-efficient lighting, new climate-friendly autos, and the usage of wind and solar power are just a few examples.<br>
<br>
Governments emphasise the need to plant more trees, minimise the use of plastics, improve natural waste recovery, and reduce pesticide use. This ecological way of living has helped humanity save other creatures from extinction while making the Earth a greener and safer ecology.<br> 
<br>
 <font size="5"><b>Conclusion</font><br></b>
<br>
It is the responsibility of every individual to save our planet from these environmental contamination agents. If preventive measures are not taken then our future generation will have to face major repercussions. The government is also taking steps to create public awareness. Every individual should be involved in helping to reduce and control pollution.p
